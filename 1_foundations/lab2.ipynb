       "If you are on a **skilled employment visa** (likely under Section 18a or 18b of the Residence Act - AufenthG) and **not a Blue Card**, the standard waiting period before you can apply for **Permanent Residence (Niederlassungserlaubnis)** is **4 years**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of the key requirements you'll need to meet at the 4-year mark:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **4 Years of Residence:** You must have resided in Germany for at least 4 years with a residence permit that allows gainful employment (your skilled employment visa counts).\n",
       "2.  **48 Months of Pension Contributions:** You must have made at least 48 months of mandatory contributions to the German statutory pension scheme.\n",
       "3.  **Secure Livelihood:** You must be able to support yourself and your family without relying on public funds (e.g., unemployment benefits, social welfare). Your current employment contract and salary slips will be assessed.\n",
       "4.  **B1 German Language Skills:** You already have this, which is excellent! This is a mandatory requirement.\n",
       "5.  **Knowledge of the Legal and Social Order and Way of Life in Germany:** You typically demonstrate this by passing the \"Leben in Deutschland\" (Living in Germany) test.\n",
       "6.  **Sufficient Living Space:** You must have adequate housing for yourself and your family (e.g., typically calculated by square meters per person).\n",
       "7.  **No Criminal Record:** You must not have any significant criminal convictions.\n",
       "8.  **No Public Funds Reliance:** You haven't received specific public benefits (like Arbeitslosengeld II or Sozialhilfe).\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, with your B1 German, you're already ahead on one crucial requirement. You will need to wait for a minimum of 4 years from the date your skilled employment visa was issued and ensure you meet all the other conditions, especially the 48 months of pension contributions.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Application Process:** Once you meet all criteria, you can submit your application to your local Ausländerbehörde (Foreigners' Office). The processing time for PR applications can vary significantly by city and current workload, ranging from a few weeks to several months.\n",
       "*   **Documentation:** Start gathering documents early (employment contracts, salary slips, pension statements, rental agreement, language certificate, \"Leben in Deutschland\" certificate, health insurance, etc.).\n",
       "*   **Blue Card vs. Skilled Worker Visa:** It's important to differentiate. Blue Card holders have faster tracks (21 months with B1 German, 33 months with A1 German), but since you explicitly stated \"not Blue Card,\" the 4-year rule applies to you.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's always a good idea to check the specific requirements with your local Ausländerbehörde a few months before your 4-year mark, as rules can sometimes have slight local variations or updates."
